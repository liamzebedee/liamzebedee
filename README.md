### G'day 👋

yo, I make lots of things. Here's a list of projects I've either built or contributed to. I'm trying to move more to building things with other people. After all, `the_whole > sum(parts)` :)

👯 I'm looking to collaborate on: hard tech (ZK, VM's, bridging, state proofs), ideas at the intersection of culture (memes) and capital (crypto), and crafting well-designed web3 products

⚡ Fun fact: I'm a [real-life cyborg](https://liamz.co/blog/im-a-cyborg-now-on-building-my-own-artificial-pancreas/)!

**Currently:** [Dappnet](https://github.com/dappnetbby/dappnet), [Take](https://github.com/liamzebedee/take.xyz) (crypto/new-media)

### Crypto Protocols.

### AI.

 * [3d-headshot-pipeline](https://github.com/liamzebedee/3d-headshot-pipeline) - A text-to-3D headshot pipeline for an AI TV show. Uses DreamGaussian, custom live import of 3d .obj's into Unity
 * [take-modern](https://github.com/liamzebedee/take-modern) - an AI-generated art gallery, consisting of a pipeline of models (concept to idea, idea to image prompt, image prompt to image) + an autogenerated portfolio.

### Zero Knowledge Cryptography,

# Interesting source code.

I like studying/collecting/archiving codebases of the classic works, specifically their v1 to get inspiration on how system design evolves.
