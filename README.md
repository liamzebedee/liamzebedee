### G'day ðŸ‘‹

yo, I make lots of things. Here's a list of projects I've either built or contributed to. I'm trying to move more to building things with other people. After all, `the_whole > sum(parts)` :)

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on: hard tech (ZK, VM's, bridging, state proofs), ideas at the intersection of culture (memes) and capital (crypto), and crafting well-designed web3 products
